🦎 Biodiversity Analysis in Protected Parks
Visualizing Conservation Insights with Power BI & Statistical Modeling

🌱 Overview
This project explores the distribution and conservation status of species observed in protected parks. By integrating data visualization with statistical analysis, it reveals patterns in species richness, highlights park-level biodiversity, and supports evidence-based environmental planning.

📊 What’s Inside
- Power BI Dashboard with dynamic visuals of species counts by conservation status
- ANOVA Analysis to assess significant differences in observations across parks
- Tukey’s HSD Test to pinpoint park pairs with statistically distinct biodiversity profiles
- Custom Color Palettes to reflect ecological categories (e.g., Endangered, Threatened)
- Interactive Matrix Views for exploring observation counts by category and location

🔬 Why It Matters
Observation counts varied significantly across parks (ANOVA p-value = 0), inviting deeper investigation into ecological drivers such as habitat quality, conservation effort, or survey frequency. The findings can inform future research and targeted biodiversity strategies.

📁 Files Included
- SpeciesObservation.pbix – Power BI report file
- TukeyResults.csv – Tukey test output for pairwise park comparisons
- Readme.md – Project documentation
- Optional: Python scripts or data cleaning notebooks if you choose to include them
